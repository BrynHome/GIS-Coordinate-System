# GIS Coordinate System
## Description  
System that indexes and provides search features for a file of GIS records.  
The system makes use of several in-memory index data structures to support:
- Importing new GIS records into the database file
- Retrieving data for all GIS records matching given geographic coordinates
- Retrieving data for all GIS records matching matching a given feature name and state
- Retrieving data for all GIS records matching that fall within a given rectangular geographic region
- Display the in-memory indices in a human-readable manner
